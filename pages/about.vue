            <h2>SYLVIA</h2>
            <p>finds great pleasure in numbers and letters, people and community. While Chad often sparks the vision, Sylvia figures out how to make it a legal reality. She’s the one to geek out with for technical questions about your project and design, and she is always eager to talk timber and local politics.</p>
            <p>When she’s not at the mill or wrangling kiddos, you can find her happy in a woodshop, hunting, gardening, or fishing.</p>

            <p>They insist that food is available and roofs and wood stoves get installed, resulting in a healthier and more productive Chad and Sylvia. They keep their parents in check, ensuring that they stay consistent with their core values and that Mud Bay Lumber Company not only works for the present but also keeps an eye on long-term environmental and economic sustainability.</p>

            <h2>SCOTT ROSSMAN</h2>
            <p>of The Stump Company is a living legend. He teams up with Mud Bay Lumber Co to ensure a steady log supply for both operations. Without Scott’s support, mentorship, and friendship, there would have been no Mud Bay Lumber Company to begin with.</p>
